A hastily put together Workout App that runs 100% offline.

This app is a personal project, crafted by me, primarily for my own use. It was designed to meet my specific needs, ensuring that I have a hassle-free and customizable tool for my fitness journey. While it wasn't originally intended for a broader audience, its simplicity and user-friendly features may resonate with others seeking a straightforward workout logging solution.
